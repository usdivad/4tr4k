4TR4K
=====

4tr4k is a performance interface that explores the applicability of web-based platforms for semi-automated improvisation and algorithmic composition. The tools it provides make for a robust system that encourages abstractions in musical thinking, particularly in terms of improvising with sequences rather than on a note-by-note basis.

See "4tr4k thoughts & documentation" (in .pdf and .docx format) for more information.
